# OpenCode Agent Loop

[![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-pre--release-yellow?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode-agent-loop)

A reusable OpenCode agent-loop package for autonomous feature development in any software project.

The agent-loop provides a complete feature lifecycle: plan → approve → test → build → verify → review → fix → escalate → commit, with automatic model routing and failover across multiple providers.

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode-agent-loop.git
   cd opencode-agent-loop
   ```

2. **Install the package**
   ```bash
   bash scripts/install.sh
   ```

3. **Activate for your shell**
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
   ```

4. **Initialize your project**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   opencode
   /loop-init
   ```

5. **Run a feature**
   ```bash
   opencode
   /feature Implement user authentication system
   ```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The agent-loop implements a complete feature development lifecycle with six specialized agents working in sequence:

### Agent Roles

| Agent | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| **Orchestrator** | Primary decision-maker that plans tasks and delegates to specialized agents |
| **Test Agent** | Establishes baseline and verifies implementation quality |
| **Build Agent** | Implements the requested feature |
| **Review Agent** | Inspects diffs and enforces quality gates |
| **Escalation Agent** | Handles complex failures and exceptional cases |
| **Reconcile Agent** | Final validation before commit |

See [docs/agent-roles.md](docs/agent-roles.md) for detailed role definitions.

## 🔧 Installation

### Prerequisites

- OpenCode CLI (v1.0+)
- Node.js (v18+)
- Git

### Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
# git clone https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode-agent-loop.git
# cd opencode-agent-loop

# Run the installer
bash scripts/install.sh

# Activate for the current shell
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

The installer:
- Adds `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` to your shell configuration
- Makes agent-loop commands available globally
- Sets up configuration directory structure

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

The agent-loop uses a **paid-primary cloud routing** system with automatic failover across multiple providers.


### Model Routing

Each agent role has a defined model pool that is tried in sequence:
- Paid models first
- Free models as fallback when all paid options are exhausted

Configuration files:
- `config/free-first-pools.json` - Model pools per agent role
- `config/model-registry.json` - 79 models with capability scores and privacy classifications
- `config/free-first-config.json` - Global failover, cooldown, and privacy settings

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for detailed configuration reference.

### Key Principles


- **Free-first routing**: Each role tries paid models from multiple providers before attempting free fallback
- **Provider diversity**: No single provider is a single point of failure
- **Cooldown management**: Models that fail (429, 503, timeout) are placed in cooldown for configurable durations
- **Task state preservation**: Task state is checkpointed before switching models
- **Privacy-aware routing**: Sensitive tasks exclude models from providers with unsuitable data policies


---

## 🛡️ Safety Model


The agent-loop implements multiple safety protections:

### Model Selection Safeguards

- **Privacy classification**: Tasks are classified by sensitivity before model assignment
- **Provider restrictions**: Models from providers with unsuitable data policies are excluded for sensitive tasks
- **Cooldown enforcement**: Failed models are temporarily disabled to prevent repeated failures


### Workflow Safeguards

- **Stage enforcement**: Each workflow stage has explicit entry/exit criteria
- **Retry limits**: Maximum 2 fix cycles before escalation
- **Checkpointing**: Task state is preserved across model switches
- **User approval gates**: Critical decisions require user confirmation


See [docs/safety-model.md](docs/safety-model.md) for comprehensive safety documentation.

## 📋 Workflow Stages


```
PLANNING
│ Inspect repository, discover commands, produce plan
▼
AWAITING_APPROVAL
│ User reviews and approves the plan
▼
BASELINE_TESTING
│ Test agent establishes baseline metrics
▼
IMPLEMENTING
│ Build agent implements the requested feature
▼
VERIFYING
│ Test agent verifies implementation quality
▼
REVIEWING
│ Review agent inspects diff and quality gates
   ├── PASS ──► READY_TO_COMMIT
   │
   └── FAIL ──► FIXING (back to IMPLEMENTING, max 2 cycles)
         │
         └── 2 failures ──► ESCALATING
               │
               ▼
         (back to BASELINE_TESTING)
